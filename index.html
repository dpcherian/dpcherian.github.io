        		<h1>Philip Cherian</h1>
				<p>Hello. This page is mainly to keep track of my course notes and teaching material, most of which was created during my time as a Teaching Fellow at the Physics Department of <em>Ashoka University</em>.</p> 
        <p>The notes are available <a href="/teaching">here.</a></p>
        <p>Before my time at Ashoka, I completed my undergraduate degree from St. Stephen's College, Delhi University, and my master's degrees from both the Ecole Polytechnique and the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris.   </p>
