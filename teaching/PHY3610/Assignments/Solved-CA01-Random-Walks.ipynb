Each random walk on its own is not spherically symmetric -- in fact, each walker generally seems less likely to return towards the origin as time progresses -- but the bundle certainly is, which is a reflection of the fact that the mechanism that creates such a walk does not favour any particular direction. Additionally, while the walk initially seems to grow noticeably, the returns are diminishing, and it is rather the area of the bundle that seems to scale up with time rather than the radius. This is corroborated by the result in the next part of the question.\n",

To justify our claim that the functional relation is linear, we also plot a log-log plot above. Since the range of values spans multiple orders on both axes (1e1 to 1e4), the log-log plot can be trusted to give a close functional approximation to a power law, if such a relationship exists. The power of $t$ is very close to 1 (around 1.11) within the error expected for only 50 random walks.\n",
