			<h1>About</h1>
      <p>I really haven't done enough to put anything here.</p>
      <p>Before my time at Ashoka, I completed my undergraduate degree from <a href="https://www.ststephens.edu/">St. Stephen's College, Delhi University</a>, and my master's degrees from both the <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">Ecole Polytechnique</a> and the <a href="https://www.ens.fr/">Ecole Normale Superieure</a> in Paris.   </p>
